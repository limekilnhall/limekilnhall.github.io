		<h2>Iaido - “The Art of Drawing the Sword”</h2>
        <p>Iaido is a Japanese martial art that focuses on the technical aspects of drawing the sword from its scabbard in 
            a controlled and efficient manner.
            It involves a series of kata, or forms, that simulate real-life combat scenarios.
            Practitioners of Iaido, known as iaidoka, use a wooden sword or a blunt-edged metal sword called an iaito to 
            perform these kata. The emphasis is on precision, fluidity of movement, and mental focus rather than 
            physical strength or aggression.</p>

		<h3>Zen Nippon Kendō Renmei Iaidō</h3>
		<p>ZNKR stands for Zen Nippon Kendo Renmei, which is the All Japan Kendo Federation. It is the governing body for kendo in Japan. 
            ZNKR Iaido, also known as Seitei Iaido or Zenkenren Iaido, is the standardized form of iaido promoted by the ZNKR. 
            It consists of twelve kata (forms) that were compiled from various traditional schools of iaido. 
            These kata are used for training, grading, and competition within the ZNKR and affiliated organizations worldwide.
            ZNKR Iaido emphasizes the technical aspects of drawing the sword and performing efficient strikes, while also 
            promoting mental focus, discipline, and respect for tradition.</p>
		<p>.</p> 
        <h3>Koryu</h3>
        <p><b>Koryu</b> translates to "ancient school" or "traditional school." In the realm of Japanese martial arts, it refers 
            to schools that have maintained their lineage and teaching methods largely unchanged since their establishment, 
            often centuries ago. 

            <b>Koryu Iaido</b> specifically encompasses these traditional schools of swordsmanship that focus on iaido techniques. These schools transmit
             their knowledge through direct lineage from master to student, preserving the original teachings and philosophies.
            Koryu Iaido schools often have their own unique kata (forms), emphasizing historical accuracy and practical application of swordsmanship principles.
            
        <h3>Muso Jikiden Eishin-ryu (MJER)</h3>
            
            <b>Muso Jikiden Eishin-ryu</b> is one of the most prominent Koryu Iaido schools. It was founded in the 17th century by Hayashizaki Jinsuke Shigenobu, 
            a renowned swordsman.
            MJER is known for its emphasis on natural, efficient movements and the concept of "mushin," or "no-mind," a state of mental clarity and focus.
            The school has a structured curriculum that progresses through various levels of proficiency, culminating in the attainment of the highest rank 
            of "Soke" (head of the school).
            
            <h4>Key Differences between Koryu Iaido and ZNKR Iaido</h4>
            
            While both Koryu Iaido and ZNKR Iaido share the foundation of drawing the sword and performing efficient strikes, there are some key distinctions:
            
            <ul>
                <li><b>Accuracy:</b> Koryu Iaido prioritizes preserving historical accuracy in its techniques and philosophies, while ZNKR Iaido focuses on a standardized set of kata for wider practice and competition.</li>
                <li><b>Individuality:</b> Koryu Iaido often allows for greater individual expression and interpretation within the framework of the school's teachings, whereas ZNKR Iaido emphasizes uniformity in its kata.</li>
                <li><b>Competition:</b> ZNKR Iaido has a competitive aspect, with national and international tournaments held regularly. While some Koryu schools may have demonstrations or exhibitions, competition is generally not a central focus.</li>
            </ul>
            <p></p>In essence, Koryu Iaido represents the historical roots of iaido, preserving ancient traditions and emphasizing individual expression, while 
            ZNKR Iaido provides a standardized framework for learning and practicing iaido, promoting both technical proficiency and mental discipline.
